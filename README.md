# CS 300 Projects: Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains work from the CS 300 course, showcasing key concepts in data structures and algorithms. The portfolio includes two main artifacts:
1. **Runtime and Memory Analysis:** Analysis of the runtime and memory usage for the data structures used in the projects (`runtime_memory_analysis.txt`).
2. **Course Sorting Program:** Working code that sorts and prints a list of courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order.

The following sections provide a reflection on the projects completed during the course.

## Reflection on the CS 300 Projects

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The projects focused on implementing and analyzing various data structures to solve real-world problems. In Project One, the goal was to implement efficient data structures (Vector, Hash Table, and Binary Search Tree) to store, search, and sort data related to course information. Project Two required sorting and printing a list of courses in alphanumeric order, demonstrating the practical application of sorting algorithms and data structure manipulation.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The approach involved selecting the appropriate data structure for each task based on their time complexity characteristics and memory usage. Understanding data structures is crucial for optimizing performance, as different structures offer varying efficiencies for insertion, searching, and sorting operations. The choice of Vector, Hash Table, or Binary Search Tree was made depending on the specific requirements of each task.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Throughout the projects, various challenges arose, such as dealing with unbalanced Binary Search Trees or resolving hash collisions in Hash Tables. These were overcome by implementing additional logic, such as tree balancing techniques or collision resolution strategies like chaining. Extensive testing and debugging helped identify and resolve issues, ensuring the implementations met the project's requirements.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
These projects expanded my understanding of selecting data structures based on the problem's requirements and constraints. I gained insights into how choosing the right structure can significantly improve algorithm efficiency and resource usage. Additionally, the projects encouraged writing modular and reusable code, which is vital for maintaining and extending software solutions.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on these projects emphasized the importance of writing clear, well-documented code with proper naming conventions, modular functions, and thorough comments. This approach makes the code more readable and maintainable. Furthermore, implementing different data structures highlighted the need to design programs that can be easily adapted to accommodate new requirements or changes in data representation.
